## 🧭 Career Counselling

### ✨ Reflection:
Coming out of high school, I found myself uncertain about the specific career path to pursue. I took a deliberate approach and decided to take a couple of years to explore my interests, trying out different subjects and gaining exposure to various fields. This exploratory phase helped me understand that career choices are not always immediate, and it's okay to take time to identify what truly aligns with one's strengths and passions.

Through this period, I started recognizing that my interests leaned towards fields that combined creativity with technology. While I initially lacked clarity, I eventually found my calling in Information Technology, focusing on areas like applications development and UI/UX design. This reflective process emphasized the importance of career counselling and mentorship, as these resources were key in helping me clarify my goals.

As a result, I now have a better understanding of what I enjoy doing and how I can align my academic pursuits with a fulfilling career. The guidance from career professionals has been invaluable in showing me how to approach my career journey strategically, despite the initial uncertainty I faced.

One of the key resources that helped me understand career options in Information Technology was the [Careers in ICT – IITPSA](https://www.iitpsa.org.za/careers-in-ict-info/) page. It provided practical insights into different roles, including Applications Development, which sparked my interest in the field.

## 💡 Skills & Interests

Throughout my academic journey in Information and Communication Technology, I’ve developed a strong interest in backend development. My focus has consistently been on understanding how systems function behind the scenes—how data is processed, stored, and managed efficiently.

I’ve grown confident working with technologies such as **Java**, **SQL**, and database design. These tools have allowed me to build structured, logical solutions to complex problems. One of the most rewarding parts of my learning experience has been designing and implementing Java applications that interact with databases—this has not only sharpened my technical skills, but also helped me improve my ability to plan, debug, and manage code effectively.

These experiences have helped me develop the following key skills:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java  
- Database design and SQL querying  
- Writing clean, maintainable backend code  
- Debugging and error handling  
- Logical thinking and problem-solving  

While I continue to strengthen my skills in backend development, I’ve also come to appreciate how important it is to understand the full lifecycle of application development. I'm eager to explore how these skills can be applied in real-world environments where secure, scalable, and efficient systems are needed.
