## 🧭 Career Counselling

### ✨ Reflection:
Coming out of high school, I found myself uncertain about the specific career path to pursue. I took a deliberate approach and decided to take a couple of years to explore my interests, trying out different subjects and gaining exposure to various fields. This exploratory phase helped me understand that career choices are not always immediate, and it's okay to take time to identify what truly aligns with one's strengths and passions.

Through this period, I started recognizing that my interests leaned towards fields that combined creativity with technology. While I initially lacked clarity, I eventually found my calling in Information Technology, focusing on areas like applications development and UI/UX design. This reflective process emphasized the importance of career counselling and mentorship, as these resources were key in helping me clarify my goals.

As a result, I now have a better understanding of what I enjoy doing and how I can align my academic pursuits with a fulfilling career. The guidance from career professionals has been invaluable in showing me how to approach my career journey strategically, despite the initial uncertainty I faced.
